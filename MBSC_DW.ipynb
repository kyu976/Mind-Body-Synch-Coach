    "**Objective**: In the current wearable technology market, users are flooded with objective health metrics (e.g., \"You slept 8 hours\"), yet many suffer from \"Orthosomnia\"—the anxiety or disconnect between their tracked data and how they actually feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to solve this business problem by developing a **\"Cognitive Sleep Coach\"**. By analyzing the gap between **Objective Recovery** (Fitbit data) and **Subjective Fatigue** (Survey data), we will propose a solution that provides personalized cognitive reframing to improve user retention and daily vitality."

    "## Problem Statement: The \"Orthosomnia\" Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context**: Wearable devices provide accurate sleep architecture data, yet many users suffer from \"Paradoxical Insomnia\" or \"Orthosomnia\"—feeling tired despite good data, or obsessing over scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pain Point**: Current health apps fail to explain why a user feels tired when their data looks \"green.\" This leads to a loss of trust in the device and high churn rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Opportunity**: Leveraging the discrepancy between **Objective Metrics** (HRV, Sleep Efficiency, REM) and **Subjective Metrics** (Stress, Mood, Perceived Quality) to provide actionable psychological and physiological insights."

    "This project leverages a **multi-modal dataset** that maps **Objective Biometric Data** (wearable) with **Subjective Self-Report Data** (survey) to analyze and resolve the \"Sleep Perception Gap.\" The key data columns utilized are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Objective Sleep Metrics (Wearable-based Ground Truth)**\n",
    "Physiological data collected via wearable devices, serving as the \"Ground Truth\" for physical recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `main_sleep_efficiency` **(Sleep Efficiency)**: The ratio of total time asleep to total time in bed (%). A key indicator of sleep density.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `main_sleep_minutes_asleep` **(Total Sleep Time)**: The actual duration of sleep in minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `main_sleep_rem_minutes` **/** `main_sleep_deep_minutes`: Duration of specific sleep stages responsible for mental (REM) and physical (Deep) recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HRV` **(Heart Rate Variability)**: A physiological marker for stress recovery during sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Subjective Sleep Metrics (Survey-based Perception)**\n",
    "\"Feelings\" reported by users every morning. These serve as the comparative baseline to calculate the \"Gap\" against objective metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `selfreport_sleep_quality` **(Subjective Sleep Quality)**: The user's perceived overall satisfaction with their sleep (Likert Scale).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `selfreport_hours_slept`: The sleep duration as perceived by the user. By comparing this with main_sleep_minutes_asleep, we quantify **\"Time Perception Distortion\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `selfreport_SOL` **(Sleep Onset Latency)**: Subjective estimation of time taken to fall asleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Target Variables (Morning Readiness & Mood)**\n",
    "The final prediction targets (Y) representing the User Experience (UX) outcomes we aim to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `energy_morning`: The primary target variable (Y). We aim to predict and improve this score.\n",

    "**D. Contextual Features (Lifestyle Factors)**\n",
    "External factors influencing sleep quality and perception, used for **Root Cause Analysis**.\n",
